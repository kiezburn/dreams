 
** WELCOME TO KIEZ BURN 2019
------------------------------------------------------------

 You are now entering the Kiez Burn Universe.

Kiez Burn is founded on 11 Principles (https://kiezburn.org/home/about/11-principles/) , which help guide our community. These principles together with your creative mind and body will make what it is. In the following text we will tell you, how you may become a creator of our cultural gathering. 

We are happy to have you =) 

 
** REALIZING WILD DREAMS
------------------------------------------------------------

We are happy to announce that this year we are using the _Dreams Platform_ to make all our projects and art installations come true! This can be used to help allocate funds for many exciting projects. As a ticket holder, you will each get 10 tokens, which can be used to vote for your favorite Dream(s). By voting, _you_ are shaping Kiez Burn as a participatory cultural event and turn dreams into realities. How to Vote for Dreams (https://talk.kiezburn.org/d/XuQfkgMY/how-to-vote-for-dreams) .

Want to bring something to Kiez Burn yourself? Of course, you may also get your own dreams funded! How to create a Dream (https://talk.kiezburn.org/d/IfeZXG9a/manual-for-dreamers-read-this-if-you-want-to-submit-a-dream) .

You can and really should register at Dreams.Kiezburn.org (http://dreams.kiezburn.org/) with the _email address you used to purchase your ticket_ and spend your tokens on awesome stuff! But you must do it before April 30th, otherwise they might turn into bursting bubbles.

** VOLUNDEERING IS SEXY!
------------------------------------------------------------

Kiez Burn is a 100% volunteer run event — we all put in our time and energy to make the magic happen. Volunteering is the best way to get involved and everyone is expected to sign-up and be present for 1 or 2 shifts during the event. Gate, Rangers, LNT, Welfare, Build — these are just a few of the groups that keep the event running smoothly. Without your help these things can't happen. Note: Volunteering is fun.

** FORM OR JOIN A KIEZ
------------------------------------------------------------

The principle of radical self-reliance means you have to bring everything you could possibly need for the event: fun, self-expression, learning and community with you to site (food, drinks, tents, chill out spaces, workshops, art, entertainment, clean up).

Kieze are camps which bring together like-minded people to create, share and gift back to the community. We highly recommend that you join a Kieze, or create one yourself.

See which Kieze have already registered (https://kiezburn.org/camps/kieze-2019/) their camps for 2019.
